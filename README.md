# Cpp-lex-yac-parser

This project was written in April 2015 as part of my "Compiler Design" course project at R V College of Engineering (Bangalore, India).

The parser uses custom written grammar.

Objective: Print whether the given C++ file has syntax errors

Where is this C++ file?
sam.cpp

Play around with this file to test my parser

And where is this file referenced?
main function of yac_and_run.y

How to run (#):
lex lex_file.l
yacc yac_and_run.y
cc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
./a.out

Except sam.cpp, lex_file.l, yac_and_run.y : all the other files are generated by the above commands.

(#) If lex command cannot be found: use one of these command s
sudo apt install flex
sudo apt install flex-old
